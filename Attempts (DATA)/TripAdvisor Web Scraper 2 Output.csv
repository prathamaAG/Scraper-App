Must visit once in a lifetime.,15 contributions,"The Boat ride on the ghats of the holy ganga river is absolutely not  what i had come to expect after reading other reviews. First of all, I am surprised that kashi being a place where mainly senior citizens visit,  does not have  a single ghat which is accessible by wheel chair.  The newest Ghat Ramghat has a ramp but was closed.  The boat dock is a good 60 to 70 steps down. Next thing the boat operator takes you for the 30 min ride parallel to the ghats with out caring to explain the importance or history of any of the ghat. Most boats are motor boats which is so noisy, it just spoils the serenity of the holy ganges. Near the end of the ride arnd 6.30 pm, the boat operator steers the boat near to the ghats where evening Ganga Aarti is being performed, There are already about a 100 other boats and many more coming next jostling for space. Our boat guy managed to find space and we were about 6 to 7 rows of boats from the ghats. Now there are 2 groups of people in the Ghats who are performing evening aarti in the ghats and we were in the middle, so we are like listening to aarti, dhol and the chanting from both sides which is not is sync and chaotic. Then there are vendors who are selling tea and water and what not jumping from boat to boat.  All in all not at all a pleasant experience  for me unlike as mentioned in other reviews.",Mar 2023,,,,2024-01-24T13:55:29Z

This place is awful. Trash everywhere, cow and human feces along the river, and the water is just disgusting with animal and human waste. I wouldn't even let a drop of water from the river get onto my body let alone take a swim in it. You walk along and get to witness the cremation on the ghats. We watched  from afar  as we wanted to respect the family's private moment. One Chinese guy was taking pictures of the bodies and we saw a family member snatch the camera from him and smashing it on the floor. So please be respectful and avoid taking pictures of the bodies. As we were watching the cremations, we were approached by teenagers offering us a menu of drugs. My husband told them to go away about three times and they wouldn't listen. Finally he told them he would get the police if they wouldn't stop. As you walk along the river you will be harassed by kids asking for money, men who try to sell you a boat ride and almost force you into their boats, people chasing you asking you to get a haircut by them, drug dealers, and random Indian locals approaching you trying to strike a conversation so they can convince you to buy whatever they're selling. So in summary,  this is what you will encounter at the holy, spiritual, famous Ganges River: filth, human and animal waste, harassment, obnoxious and pushy sellers (if you get on a boat ride, the pushy sellers are on the river too, following you on their boat!!), NO peace or spiritual moments. Only tiredness, frustration and disgust. We will never ever visit this dump again.",Dec 2017,,,,2024-01-24T13:55:29Z

And it was. We arrived the day of Maha Shivrati  ( very sacred date for Shiva´s - an hindu deity, who habitates Varanasi), therefore a lot of devotees and pilgrims where arriving at Ganges river to bath , drink , and clean their sins. We have the magnificent oportunity thanks to our guide Daya Tiwari to enter a small Market, a very narrow place where to buy scences and some sacred rudrashkas ( no pics allowed).. Even we got some sandal paste in our foreheads from our guide who collected some for us while he attended a temple just for hinduist.  When my friend and I  saw during  the aftenoon the daily ceremony for Ganga river and in the sunrise also the offerings for our wishes for our friends, family and ourselves, our spines chilled ( in a good way), and  the feeling was undescribable. I was thinking in being shocked for all the legends of having corpses floating in the river while sailing them in the little boats, or the smell between human ashes, cow urine and all those mixtures you could find with so many people, but nothing so far reality. Many people would say that I could manage that  because I am used to big crowds and crazyness in my lovely Mexico City, but  If there were only one place to return, with closed eyes  I would choose Varanasi..",May 2011 • Friends,,,,2024-01-24T13:55:29Z
